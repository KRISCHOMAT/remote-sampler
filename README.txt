A super collider sampler instrument that can be controlled with a web app.

The Idea behind it is, that the audience can do live sampling. There can be 3 users at the same time. Other request are directed to a cueue.

Things to be optimized:
Multitouch/ Polyphony:
    - already implemented, but when enabled it happens more often that a node in super collider cannot be freed.
